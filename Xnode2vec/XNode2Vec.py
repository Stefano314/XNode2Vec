    Description
    -----------
    Performs FastNode2Vec algorithm with full control on the crucial parameters.
    In particular, this function allows the user to keep working with networkx objects
    -- that are generally quite user-friendly -- instead of the ones required by the fastnode2vec
    algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx.Graph object
        Sets the network that will be analyzed by the algorithm.
    p : float
        Sets the probability '1/p' necessary to perform the fastnode2vec random walk. It affects how often the walk is
        going to immediately revisit the previous node. The smaller it is, the more likely the node will be revisited.
    q : float
        Sets the probability '1/q' necessary to perform the fastnode2vec random walk. It affects how far the walk
        will go into the network. The smaller it is, the larger will be the distance from the initial node.
    node : int, optional
        Sets the node from which to start the analysis. This is a gensim.models.word2vec parameter.
        The default value is '1'.
    walk_length : int
        Sets the number of jumps to perform from node to node.
    save_model : bool, optional
        Saves in the working directory a .wordvectors file that contains the performed training.
        It's important to consider is that the **methods** of the "Word2Vec" model saved can be accessed
        as "model_name.wv". The documentation of ".wv" is found however under 
        "gensim.models.keyedvectors.KeyedVectors" istance; they are the same thing, ".wv" is just a rename.
        The default value is 'False'.
    picked : int, optional
        Sets the first 'picked' nodes that are most similar to the node identified with 'node'. This is a
        gensim.models.word2vec parameter.
        The default value is '10'.
    train_time : int, optional
        Sets the number of times we want to apply the algorithm. It is the 'epochs' parameter in Node2Vec.
        The value of this parameter drastically affect the computational time.
        The default value is '5'.
    Weight : bool, optional
        Specifies if the algorithm must also consider the weights of the links. If the networks is unweighted this
        parameter must be 'False', otherwise it receives too many parameters to unpack.
        The default value is 'False'.
    dim : int, optional
        This is the Word2Vec "size" argument. It sets the dimension of the algorithm word vector. The longer it is, the
        more complex is the specification of the word -- object. If a subject has few features, the word length should
        be relatively short.
        The default value is '128'.
    context : int, optional
        This is the Word2Vec "window" parameter. It sets the number of words **before** and **after** the current one that will
        be kept for the analysis. Depending on its value, it manages to obtain words that are interchangeable and
        relatable -- belonging to the same topic. If the value is small, 2-15, then we will likely have interchangeable
        words, while if it is large, >15, we will have relatable words.
        The default value is '10'
    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray, ndarray
        The output of the function is a tuple of two numpy arrays. The first contains the top 'picked' most similar
        nodes to the 'node' one, while the second contains their similarities with respect to the 'node' one.

    Notes
    -----
    - The node parameter is by default an integer. However, this only depends on the node labels that are given to the
      nodes in the network.
    - The rest of the parameters in **kwargs are the ones in fastnode2vec.Node2Vec constructor, I only specified what I
      considered to be the most important ones.
    - I noticed that the walk_length parameter should be at least #Nodes/2 in order to be a solid walk.
